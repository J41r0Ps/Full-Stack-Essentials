# Exercise 1: CSS Selectors (Basic and Advanced)

## Objective

Understand and practice different types of CSS selectors including:
- Element selectors
- Class and ID selectors
- Descendant and child selectors
- Attribute selectors
- Pseudo-classes

## Tasks

âœ… Create an `index.html` and `style.css`  
âœ… Add the following elements to your HTML:
- At least 2 different elements with classes
- At least 1 element with an ID
- A `ul` with `li` items
- An `<input type="text">` field
- At least 1 `<a>` link

âœ… In `style.css`, use these selectors:
1. Element selector (`p { ... }`)
2. Class selector (`.title { ... }`)
3. ID selector (`#main { ... }`)
4. Descendant selector (`.box p { ... }`)
5. Direct child selector (`ul > li { ... }`)
6. Attribute selector (`input[type="text"] { ... }`)
7. Pseudo-class selector (`a:hover { ... }`)

âœ… Link the CSS file in your HTML and verify styles apply correctly.

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus (optional):
- Add `:nth-child(odd)` or `:first-child` somewhere to show extra control

This exercise is designed to solidify your grasp of how CSS selectors target and style HTML elements in different ways.

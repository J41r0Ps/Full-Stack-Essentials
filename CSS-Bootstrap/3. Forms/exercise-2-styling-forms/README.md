# Exercise 2: Styling Forms with Bootstrap

## Objective

Practice using Bootstrap 5 form classes to style your forms cleanly and responsively.

## Tasks

✅ Create an `index.html` using:
- `container` and `row` classes for layout
- `form-control` for inputs and textarea
- `form-select` for the dropdown
- `form-check` for radio buttons and checkboxes
- A styled submit button (`btn btn-primary`)

✅ Ensure the form looks good on both desktop and mobile

✅ Optional: Add one small custom CSS tweak (like changing the background or adding margin)

This exercise helps you integrate Bootstrap’s form styling classes into your projects.

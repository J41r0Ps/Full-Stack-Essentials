# Exercise 1: Form Elements

## Objective

Practice building a complete HTML form using different form elements.

## Tasks

✅ Create an `index.html` with:
- A form (`<form>`) that includes:
    - A text input (`<input type="text">`)
    - An email input (`<input type="email">`)
    - A textarea (`<textarea>`)
    - A select dropdown (`<select>` with at least 3 options)
    - A set of radio buttons
    - A checkbox

✅ Add labels (`<label>`) for each input

✅ Use proper name and id attributes to link labels to inputs

✅ Add a submit button

✅ Make sure the form is cleanly structured inside a container or card

This exercise helps you practice all major HTML form elements before we move on to styling them.

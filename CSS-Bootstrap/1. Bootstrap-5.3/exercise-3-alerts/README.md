# Exercise 3: Bootstrap Alerts

## Objective

Practice using Bootstrap alert components with different styles and interactive features.

## Tasks

✅ Create an `index.html` that includes:
- At least 4 different alert types:
    - `alert alert-primary`
    - `alert alert-success`
    - `alert alert-warning`
    - `alert alert-danger`

✅ Make at least one alert **dismissible** (can be closed by the user)

✅ Add a Font Awesome icon inside at least one alert

✅ Arrange the alerts nicely inside a `container`

This exercise helps you understand how to work with Bootstrap’s alert classes and interactivity.

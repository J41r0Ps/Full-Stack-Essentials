# Exercise 4: Bootstrap Cards

## Objective

Practice creating Bootstrap card components to display content with images and text.

## Tasks

✅ Create an `index.html` that includes:
- A `container` with at least **2 Bootstrap cards**
- Each card should have:
    - An image (`<img>` with `card-img-top`)
    - A card body (`<div class="card-body">`) with:
        - A card title (`<h5 class="card-title">`)
        - Some card text (`<p class="card-text">`)
        - A button (`btn btn-primary`)

✅ Use Font Awesome on one of the buttons

✅ Arrange the cards inside a Bootstrap grid (for example, two columns on desktop, one column on mobile)

This exercise helps you practice Bootstrap’s card component, grid layout, and image integration.

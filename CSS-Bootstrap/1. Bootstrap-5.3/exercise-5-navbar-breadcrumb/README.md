# Exercise 5: Bootstrap Navbar and Breadcrumb

## Objective

Practice creating a responsive Bootstrap navbar and breadcrumb navigation.

## Tasks

✅ Create an `index.html` that includes:
- A responsive Bootstrap **navbar** with:
    - Brand/logo
    - Navigation links (e.g., Home, About, Contact)
    - Collapsible toggle for mobile (`navbar-toggler`)

✅ Use at least one Font Awesome icon in the navbar (e.g., for the brand or beside a nav link)

✅ Make sure it looks clean on desktop and mobile

This exercise helps you work with Bootstrap’s navigation components.

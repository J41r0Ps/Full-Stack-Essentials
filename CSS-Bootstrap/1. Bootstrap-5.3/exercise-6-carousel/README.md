# Exercise 6: Bootstrap Carousel

## Objective

Practice using the Bootstrap carousel component to create a responsive image slider.

## Tasks

✅ Create an `index.html` that includes:
- A Bootstrap **carousel** with at least 3 slides
- Each slide should have:
    - An image (`<img>`)
    - A caption (`<div class="carousel-caption">`) with a title and short text

✅ Include **previous** and **next** controls

✅ Add **indicators** (the small dots below the carousel)

✅ Make sure it works responsively on mobile and desktop

This exercise helps you practice Bootstrap’s interactive components and work with the JS bundle.
